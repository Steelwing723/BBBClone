# Blackboard-to-google-calendar
blackboard helper (working title ofc)
    initial setup:
        "let's add your classes..."
        - user selects all the classes they're in
          (some might be stupid stuff like destination arkansas so let the user skip those)
        "please select the tab that your assignments fall under"
        - user selects probably the content tab, that way the program knows where to look for assignments
        "want to set up notifications/alerts when an assigment is coming up or an announcement posted?"
        - user selects whatever
        "does this class have lecture notes? would you like to add them along with the calendar entries?"
        - user selects the tab with lecture notes, after class, the program will add the lecture notes to
          that day on the calendar
    after setup:
        main page:
            - shows all classes
            - shows all assignments due soon under each class
            - shows direct links to access a call (instead of clicking through multiple menus .-.)
            - idk we have lots of options here
